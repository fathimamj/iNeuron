    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__all__` tells the semantically “public” names from the module. If there is a name in `__all__`, the users are expected to use it, and they can expect that it will not change. By default, Python will export all names that do not start with an `_.` we certainly could rely on this mechanism."

The current module in which we are working is refer to the string `__main __`."

    "\n",
    "An advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for parentheses that are required by infix notation. While 3 − 4 × 5 can also be written 3 − (4 × 5), that means something quite different from (3 − 4) × 5. A program counter is also known as an instruction counter, instruction pointer, instruction address register or sequence control register. It is a digital counter needed for faster execution of tasks as well as for tracking the current execution point"
