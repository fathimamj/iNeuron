    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. These factors include the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.\n",

    "**Ans:** : \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between true random number generators(TRNGs) and pseudo-random number generators(PRNGs) is that TRNGs use an unpredictable physical means to generate numbers (like atmospheric noise), and PRNGs use mathematical algorithms (completely computer-generated). pseudo-random number are good enough because we usually don't need true randomness for most applications. What We need is unpredictability. If we're using a random number generator in a game, we don't care if the numbers are truly random; we only care that they aren't predictable."

    "A Real-life example of a normal distribution are heights or blood pressure measurements and Rolling A Dice - A fair rolling of dice is also a good example of normal distribution. In an experiment, it has been found that when a dice is rolled 100 times, chances to get '1' are 15-18% and if we roll the dice 1000 times, the chances to get '1' is, again, the same, which averages to 16.7% (1/6)."
