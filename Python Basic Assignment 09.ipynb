    "An absolute path is a path that contains the entire path to the file or directory that we need to access. This path will begin at the home directory of your computer and will end with the file or directory that we wish to access.  Absolute paths ensure that Python can find the exact file on computer. Basically we can say that absolute paths start with the root folder, such as / or C:\\.\n",

You may want to use readline() when you're reading files that are too big for your RAM.\n",
