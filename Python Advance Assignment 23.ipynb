    "### Q1. If you have any, what are your choices for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph?\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib provides a convenient method called subplots for increasing the comparison between different figures on the same graph. Subplots mean a group of smaller axes (where each axis is a plot) that can exist together within a single figure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Compound interest causes one's wealth to grow faster. It makes a sum of money grow at a faster rate than simple interest because one will earn returns on the money other invest, as well as on returns at the end of every compounding period. This means that one don't have to put away as much money to reach others goals."
